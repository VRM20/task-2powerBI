# üìä Superstore Sales and Profit Analysis Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI report developed using the **Superstore dataset**. The goal of this project is to analyze sales and profit trends across different regions, product categories, and states to uncover actionable insights for improving business performance.

## üîç Dashboard Overview

The Power BI report consists of the following key visuals:

- **Sales by Region and Category**: Shows how sales are distributed across Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology in different U.S. regions.
- **Profit by State**: A choropleth map showing state-level profit variations, highlighting regions with negative profit.
- **Sales Trend Over Time**: A time-series line graph showing monthly sales growth from 2014 to 2017.
- **Profit vs Sales by Category**: Bar and scatter charts showing sub-category performance and highlighting profit margins relative to sales.
